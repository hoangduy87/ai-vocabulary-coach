📘 AI Vocabulary Coach
An AI-powered vocabulary learning assistant that helps users remember words better through spaced repetition, daily learning goals, mini-games, and performance tracking.

📌 Summary
AI Vocabulary Coach helps people learn vocabulary in a smarter and more fun way. It uses spaced repetition to decide when to review words, and includes mini-games to make learning enjoyable. It solves the problem of forgetting new words and feeling bored with traditional methods.

🧭 Background
Many language learners (especially beginners) struggle with remembering new words and staying motivated. This is common for those studying English or Korean by themselves. Our app provides a simple and engaging way to build vocabulary daily.

⚙️ How is it used?
Users add new vocabulary words with meanings, examples, type, and category. The app recommends 5 new words per day and selects review words based on performance and time since last review. Mini-games allow fun practice, and the app tracks learning progress over time.

📊 Data & AI Methods
The app uses a local CSV file to store vocabulary and learning history. It tracks:

Number of reviews

Correct/incorrect answers

Last reviewed date

Topic and difficulty

Future versions may apply:

Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2)

NLP to suggest related words or generate examples

Simple machine learning to personalize review order

🌍 Impact
The app helps users grow their vocabulary faster and feel more confident using the language. It's especially useful for people who learn on their own or in low-resource settings.

🚧 Challenges
Collecting enough data to personalize learning

Keeping users engaged long-term

Scaling the system to more languages and levels
